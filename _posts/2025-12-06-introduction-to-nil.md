Hi!

This is my first blog post... ever! I don't know how to go about these sorts of things, but what I DO know is that I want this blog to be quite minimalistic. I quite enjoy the simpler looks, without much eye strain. As the time goes on, I'll slowly add new things to the website to try and make it more "professional".

Until then, this is mostly an introductory post on my new project: NIL, which is an acronym for No Inherent Logic. This is a sandbox game that, as the name implies, follows no inherent logic of the real world. Of course, SOME things can and will resemble the real world in the sense that it's what we've known for generations; it's impossible not to take ANY sort of inspiration from things and behaviors that are so deeply rooted in us humans.

My goal with this project is to mostly rediscover the fun in programming. I've spent a good chunk of my years doing work for others, watching people grow over my hard work while I drown myself in problems to meet deadlines. All of that stole the fun I once saw in programming. So I'm throwing my fist up in the air with a huge middle finger pointing out to scream "NO!" and attempt to finally do something for myself.

With all of that said, I'd love to have your company on this journey! I'll be setting up a small "feedback" section once I figure out how to properly mess with Jekyll. React is too ingrained in my head, so messing with Jekyll has been... a journey, to say the least.

Thank you for reading, and I'll hopefully get to see you again here next time!
