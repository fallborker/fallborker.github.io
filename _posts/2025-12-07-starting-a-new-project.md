Welcome once more!

Today's post (rant?) will be quite a short one, with no real release or downloadable content. I wanna talk about the discomfort of starting something new.

Usually starting something new can be very exciting, and it is! It still excites me to go and discover what I can do, and how I can do it in ways that feel good, or that run fast or things like that, but at the same time the effort of having to set things up AGAIN for something you have ZERO assurance on can be... daunting? I don't know if that's the proper word...

I've repeated this same cycle dozens of times, on projects that never even saw the light of day, or that have never landed on the hands of anybody. It does make me quite jealous when I see people just do it somehow, and it makes me wonder if I'll ever get to that point eventually.

I sure hope so.

As to not let you all go empty-handed, have a pic from the empty window I am currently staring at (hooray for [*raylib*](https://www.raylib.com/)!)

Thank you all for joining me here, and I hope you're all having a lovely weekend :D
