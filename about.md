Hi!
My name is Fall, and I like making small games in my spare time.

This project started from a desire to distance myself from the usual sandbox loop:
 - Break wood;
 - Break stone;
 - Mine for ore;
 - Etc...
 
 I’ve played tons of games that follow that progression; these games have their own charm and metit (and I love them! This project's biggest inspiration is Terraria), but after a while I got bored of doing the same thing again and again... I wanted something that feels a bit illogical when you first play it, and rewards curiosity and exploration rather than just, yknow... repeating the same tasks. So I decided to make that game for myself, and I'm having a lot of fun figuring out what feels right!

This project is also being born from the desire I have in finding joy in programming after working with it for a couple of years, and I'd more than enjoy your company if you decide to stick around :D

Eventually the game will be sold, but for now I’m releasing it for free because I want to hear what people think. As much as staying in my own bubble is fun, feedback is important.
